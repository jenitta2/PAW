    <h1>General Mental Health issues</h1>
    <p>The creation of social skills occurs during puberty,
        a period of vital developmental growth. </p>
    <p>Early puberty may increase a young person's risk of mental health problems. 
        The most common ones during adolescence are eating disorders, conduct disorders (severe antisocial behavior), anxiety and depression, 
        attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and self-harm.
        Early puberty raises the risk of self-harm in both boys and girls. Of the 15-year-old population, 11% of boys and 32% of girls experience self-harm.</p>
    <h2>Research Paper excerpts</h2>
    <p>Adolescence is a time of profound developmental shifts, from the hormonal, physical, and mental changes associated with 
        puberty to the emergence of a more sophisticated social environment. The parallel rise in the start of numerous mental illnesses 
        has led researchers to hunt for critical developmental pathways that influence variations in psychopathology risk during this stage of life.
